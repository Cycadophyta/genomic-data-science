# 3. Python for Genomic Data Science
This class provides an introduction to the Python programming language and the iPython notebook. This is the third course in the Genomic Big Data Science Specialization from Johns Hopkins University.

## 3.1: Intro
This week we will have an overview of Python and take the first steps towards programming.

## 3.2: Data structures, loops
In this module, we'll be taking a look at Data Structures and Ifs and Loops.

## 3.3: Functions
In this module, we have a long three-part lecture on Functions as well as a 10-minute look at Modules and Packages.

## 3.4: I/O, Biopython
In this module, we have another long three-part lecture, this time about Communicating with the Outside, as well as a final lecture about Biopython.

Blast:
```python
from Bio.Blast import NCBIWWW
```

## Exam
Write a Python program that takes as input a file containing DNA sequences in multi-FASTA format, and computes the answers to the following questions. You can choose to write one program with multiple functions to answer these questions, or you can write several programs to address them. We will provide a multi-FASTA file for you, and you will run your program to answer the exam questions.
