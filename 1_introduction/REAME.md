# 1. Introduction to Genomic Technologies

## 1.1: Overview
In this Module, you can expect to study topics of "Just enough molecular biology", "The genome", "Writing a DNA sequence", "Central dogma", "Transcription", "Translation", and "DNA structure and modifications".

## 1.2: Measurement Technology
In this module, you'll learn about polymerase chain reaction, next generation sequencing, and applications of sequencing.

## 1.3: Computing Technology
The lectures for this module cover a few basic topics in computing technology. We'll go over the foundations of computer science, algorithms, memory and data structures, efficiency, software engineering, and computational biology software.

## 1.4: Data Science Technology
In this module on Data Science Technology, we'll be covering quite a lot of information about how to handle the data produced during the sequencing process. We'll cover reproducibility, analysis, statistics, question types, the central dogma of inference, analysis code, testing, prediction, variation, experimental design, confounding, power, sample size, correlation, causation, and degrees of freedom.

## Course Project
In this project you will be reading a genomic data science paper and answering some questions to help you learn about how the different fields in genomic data science work together and to evaluate your understanding of some of the concepts we have learned throughout the course.
