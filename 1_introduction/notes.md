Multiple testing
    
    When calculating lots of p values, there is a higher chance of false positives. For a uniform distribution of p values, $20 \%$ are $< 0.05$. 
    
    E.g. If 550 of 10,000 genes are significant ($p < 0.05$), there are 500 expected false positives. 
    
    Family wise error rate: (Pr # false positives $<1$) 
    
    False discovery rate: E(# false positives / # total discoveries)
    
    P value $< 0.05$
    $0.05 * 10,000 = 500$
    
    False discovery rate = $0.05 * 550 = 27.5$ false positives
