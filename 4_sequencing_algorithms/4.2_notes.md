## 4.2: Preprocessing, indexing and approximate matching

Naive exact matching was useful, but slow. Boyer-Moore is a fast and simple alternative.

Pigeon hole prnciple to search for approximate matches.

### Boyer-Moore
- Similar to naive exact matching
- If the matching algorithm meets a character not found in the kmer, it skips
- Matching is done in reverse along kmer
#### Bad character rule
- Upon mismatch, skip until (a) mismatch becomes a match, or (b) kmer moves past mismatched character
#### Good suffix rule
- Keep matches as matches and prevent them turning into mismatches
- For a partial match (matched suffix = t), when skipping ensure t still matches
- Shift to the next copy of t in kmer
